# Make-a-number
Sujan gets n numbers in an array.  
Write a Java program to take the single digit even numbers in the array 
and make a number by combining those even numbers alone.  
Example: If the array is {2,7,14,24,41,4} the output should be a single number 24, 
if not found print "Single digit even number is not found in the array".
If the array size is zero or lesser then display the message as "Invalid array size"  

Sample Input 1:

56
8

Sample Output 1:  
48
